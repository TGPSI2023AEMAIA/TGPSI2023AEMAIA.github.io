				<h1 id="renewable_energy_sources">Renewable energy sources</h1>
				<h2 id="renewable_energy_sources1">There are five major renewable energy sources</h2>
				<p>The major types or sources of renewable energy are:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Solar energy from the sun</li>
					<li>Geothermal energy from heat inside the earth</li>
					<li>Wind energy</li>
					<li>Biomass from plants</li>
					<li>Hydropower from flowing water</li>
				</ol>
				<h2 id="renewable_energy_sources2">Renewable energy meaning</h2>
				<p>
					Renewable energy is energy that is generated
					from natural processes that are continuosly
					replenished. This inclues sunlight, geothermal heat,
					wind, tides, water, and various forms of biomass. This
					energy cannot be exhausted and is constantly renewed.
				</p>
				<h2 id="renewable_energy_sources3">Solar energy</h2>
				<p>
					Solar energy is an essential source of renewable energy
					and is harnessed using a wide range of technologies such as
					solar power to generate electricity. And the large
					magnitude of solar energy available makes it an appealing
					soruce of eletricity, and is normally cheaper than fossil fuels
					since 2021.
				</p>

				<h1 id="energetic_efficiency">Energetic efficiency</h1>
				<h2 id="energetic_efficiency1">Energetic efficiency meaning</h2>
				<p>
					Energy efficiency simply means using less energy
					to perform the same task - that is, eleminating
					energy waste.
				</p>
				<h2 id="energetic_efficiency2">Benefits of energy efficiency</h2>
				<p>
					Energy efficiency brings a variety of benefits:
					reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing demand
					for energy imports, and lowering our costs on a hosehold
					and economy-wide level.
				</p>
				<p>
					While renewable energy technologies also help accomplish
					these objectives, improving energy efficiency is the cheapest - and
					often the most immediate - way to reduce the use of fossil fuels
				</p>
				<h2 id="energetic_efficiency3">The efficiency needs to improve</h2>
				<p>
					There are anourmous opportunities for efficiency improvements
					in every sector of the economy, whether it ist buildings,
					tranportation, industry, or energy generation.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="theme">
				<h1 id="sustainable_production_storage">Sustainable production & storage</h1>
				<h2 id="sustainable_production_storage1">Batteries</h2>
				<p>
					A new metal-free battery platform could lead to more
					sustainable, recyclable batteries that degrade on demand.
					<br>
					The introduction of lithium-ion batteries has revolutionized
					technolgy as a whole, leading to major advances in consumer
					goods across nearly all sectors. While the availability of
					technology is generally a good thing, the rapid growth has led
					directly to serveral key ethical and environmental issues surrounding the
					use of lithium-ion batteries.
				</p>
				<h2 id="sustainable_production_storage2">Susteinable productions</h2>
				<p>
					Geographical location of Portugal - Sustainable products
					are those products that provide environmental, social and
					economic benefits while protecting public health and environment
					over their whole life cycle, from the extraction of raw materials
					until the final disposal. The geographical location of Portugal has
					a vast coast and that favors the use of sea's forces to produce
					energy and improve susteinability.
				</p>
				<h2 id="sustainable_production_storage3">Solar cells</h2>
				<p>
					Solar cells are any device that directly converts
					the energy of the light into electrical energy trough
					the photovoltaic effect. Solar cells can be arranged into large
					groupings called arrays. These arrays, composed of many thousands
					of individual cells, can function as central eletric power stations, converting sunlight
					into electrical energy for distribution to industrial, commericial, and
					residential users.
					<br>
					The use of solar cells could help to achieve a sustainable energy
					future.

				<h1 id="next_generation_eu">Next Generation EU</h1>
				<h2 id="next_generation_eu1">Make it green</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Improve water quality in our rivers and seas,
						reduce waste and plastic litter, plant billions of trees
						and bring back the bees
					</li>
					<li>
						Create green spaces in our cities and increasse the use of
						renewable energy
					</li>
					<li>
						Make farming more environmentally-friendly so our food is
						healthier
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 id="next_generation_eu2">What is Next Generation EU</h2>
				<p>
					NextGeneretationEU is more than a recovery
					plan - it is a once in a lifetime chance to emerge
					stronger from the pandemic, transform our economies and
					societies, and design a Europe that works for everyone.
